# FAQ

Let’s start off by answering some questions you may have about resource packs.

**What is a resource pack?**\
A resource pack is a folder or .zip that changes the “assets” loaded into Minecraft. It is a way to customize or completely change how the game looks and sounds.

**Are resource packs the same as texture packs?**\
These terms are sometimes used that way, but “texture packs” were for Minecraft 1.5.2 and before, and only changed the images the game used for things like blocks, items and GUIs. Resource packs replaced this functionality, and can also manage models, sounds, and much more.

**Are they hard to make?**\
No, they are rather easy to do once you have an understanding of how Minecraft structures its assets folder. This guide will help you with that.

**Do I have to change every texture?**\
No, the great thing about Minecraft is you only need to texture the stuff you want to change. Minecraft loads your pack(s) over top of the default textures, so anything you don't change will remain the default.

**What programs do I need to make a resource pack?**\
For most resource packs, all you need is an archive tool, a plain text editor, and an image editor.

**So what is a “plain” text editor?**\
A plain text editor is a program that edits text files, but does not have fancy features like fonts, bold or colored text, and text size. Notepad and Notepad++ are examples of these. “Rich” text editors will not work, and using them will break any minecraft asset you edit with them, probably permanently. (Rich text editors include programs like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.)
