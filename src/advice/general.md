# General Advice

Before we get started I'm going to give some general advice when creating your resource pack:

- It is best to stick to one resolution size for your pack, changing resolution on a texture by texture basis can be jarring to players as well as potentially stress the texture system.
- If you want to make sure builds using default textures look good with your pack, or vice versa, use the same colors as the default texture.
- While you don't have to follow any of this advice, I recommend following them at least while you are learning how to make a resource pack.
