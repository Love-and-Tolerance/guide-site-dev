# General Advice

Before we get started I'm going to give some general advice when creating your resource pack:

- Reverse engineer other resource packs. This will help you understand how resource packs work and can help a lot when it comes to blockstates, models, and optifine.
- It is best to stick to one resolution size for your pack, changing resolution on a texture by texture basis can be jarring to players as well as potentially stress the texture system.
- If you want to make sure builds using default textures look good with your pack, or vice versa, use the same colors as the default texture.
