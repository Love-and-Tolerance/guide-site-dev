# Common mistakes

Here are some common mistakes to avoid while making your texture pack.

- Do not just copy Minecraftâ€™s assets folder and make your texture pack on top of it, this bloats the size of your resource pack and makes it hard to find and fix problems in the future. Minecraft loads your pack overtop of the default assets so this is not needed and is not recommended. (seriously, you will thank me later)
- Make sure your textures have the exact same name as default Minecraft.
- Make sure you place your textures in the right folders.
