# Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps of making your very own resource pack for Minecraft. One thing different about this guide is, itâ€™s also a resource pack! Everything covered in this guide will also be in the resource pack, so you can download it and get hands-on with everything we cover. To download the latest version, go to the releases page.

This guide has been hosted on GitHub for a reason; we want you to help make this guide the best it can be. If you see something that is wrong, or think you can expand a section to make it better, we encourage you to Fork this repository and do a Pull Request with your additions (don't forget to add yourself to the credits)!
